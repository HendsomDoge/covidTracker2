# What's new?
1) Added a country search system so that users do not have to scroll a lot to find their country
2) Added a dark and light mode switch
3) Added some videos at the bottom for the user to understand
4) Added a country leaderboard for covid-19
Note: This api also has a bug and doesn't show the recovered people so I removed it
